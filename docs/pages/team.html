          <h3>Silas Reinagel</h3>​
          <p>Silas Reinagel started programming when he was 12 years old, and jumped into the world of game development 
            doing game design and pixel art for Agent Z 2, a Palm Pilot game.<br><br>
          After honing his development skills with years of enterprise software development, the lure of creating his own games 
            grew too strong. With the help of his brother Noah Reinagel, Enigma Dragons was formed.<br><br>
          Silas is credited in multiple games, including Planet Or Die, Zero Footprint Society, and his favorite, Gnosis Disperitus.<br><br>
          His favorite titles include Chrono Trigger, Deus Ex, The Witness, and the Fire Emblem series.</p>

          <h3>Noah Reinagel</h3>​

            has participated in many game projects, including Planet or Die, Gnosis Disperitus, and Black Market Crackdown.</p>

          <p>He, along with Silas Reinagel, co-founded Enigma Dragons with the vision of making and releasing 
              the highest quality indie games money can buy. </p>

          <p>Noah's ambition is to make games that are the top of their genre, such as The Witness, 
            Everspace, or Salt and Sanctuary.</p>
