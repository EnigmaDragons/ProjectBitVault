      <h3>Project Description</h3>
      <hr>
      <p><i>BitVault</i> is a challenging cyberpunk hacking-themed puzzle game for smart people. 
        BitVault follows in the footsteps of venerated genre greats like The Witness, Monument Valley, and Baba Is You.
        It features over 60 mind-bending levels, taking you on a mental journey that tests your problem solving abilities and deduction skills.</p>
    
      <p>You will need to use logic and creativity, as well as master a small arsenal of hacking tools, to penetrate the well-protected servers before you.</p>

      <p>Unfold a light-hearted story centered around your new job as Penetration Tester for a small Cyber-Security company, 
        working for a boss who likes to cut corners and even hack into his own company's vending machines for a free midday snack.</p>
    
      <p>Break into the servers of several different companies, from the virtual data centers of a hacking nemesis, to the heavily protected government servers at the International Cybersecurity Enforcement agency.
    
      <p>While mildly reminiscent of pure logic puzzle games like The Witness, BitVault uses innovative new puzzle mechanics, and brings puzzle solving to an entirely new compelling setting!</p>
